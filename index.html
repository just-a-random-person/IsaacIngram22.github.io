      <p id="heading">Hello! My name is Isaac.</p>
      <p class="aboutMeWhite">I am a high school student who is
        interested in computer science. I plan to study
        computer science in college, and I hope to eventually
        become a software engineer.
        I'm currently a programmer for my school's
        <a class="linkWhite" href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc" target="_blank">
          FIRST Robotics Competition</a> team (team 5889), and my
        school's
        <a class="linkWhite" href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc" target="_blank">
          FIRST Tech Challenge</a> team (team 6042).
        I also mentor my school's

          FIRST Lego League</a> team (team 8498).

      <p class="aboutMeBlack">Most of my programming projects have to do with robots.
      Those robots are programmed in Java, so that is the language I use most.
      I have also experimented with Go and Swift on my own, and I built this website with
      basic html and CSS (although frontend isn't really my thing).</p>
      <p class="aboutMeBlack">Outside of school, most of my time is spent programming.
      I've worked on numerous robotics projects recently, including a system that used
      basic vision tracking to allow a FIRST Tech Challenge robot to know where it is
      on the field based on X and Y coordinates. I've also worked on an autopilot-like
      system to help align a FIRST Robotics Competition robot with its target efficiently.
